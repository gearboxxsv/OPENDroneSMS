# OpenDroneSMS

Safety Management Systems are core to all flight operations and unmanned service supplier networks.  The objective of this API is to bridge the gap for NASA ASRS and USS SMS communities.  Each flight operation will have issues, the public will have reports, and we all want to protect proprietary information and privacy, what to do? 

OpenDroneSMS is first a reporting tool, and can be a foundation to develop your own SMS program.  They key is to share your data, contribute code to the open source project, and integrate OpenDroneSMS anonymous and secure code.  Build great projects with safety at the core and help surface industry wide issues and solutions faster.

This database is used without personally identifiable information to build Safety Enhancements which are brought to all manufacturers and partners of the Unmanned Aircraft Safety Team (UnmannedAircraftSafetyTeam.org).

> 3 Step Process To Adding Safety Management Anonymous Reporting
*  Create Incident Report (API,Web)
*  Apply Prebuilt Standard Terms To Describe The Incident From UAST 
*  Supply Onsite Images, Onsite Video, Problem/Solution Statements, Submit, and Track It!
 
## ASRS
>Anonymous Safety Reporting System (ASRS) is ideal for UAS providers of USS or UTM solutions wishing to implement a safety management program. UAST will offer a platform for no charge use to any valid system or drone operator to submit a detect and avoid occurrence, safety for pilot or drone issue, injury of any kind, common issue with commercial drone model creating risk, and a general public reporting tool with PII redaction.  We collect only the facts to monitor safety issues.  We do not advise on the rules and regulations in your area. Search quickly by any GPS coordinates to get a risk score and remote pilot reports. All data provided without warranty as is based on pilot reports (ASRS), website content, crowd source, social media, and federal databases permitted for this use.

**Using the OpenDroneSMS web api is provided at no charge by the membership of the UAST.
