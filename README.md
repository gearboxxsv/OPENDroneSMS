# OpenDroneSMS

Safety Management Systems are core to all flight operations and unmanned service supplier networks.  The objective of this API is to bridge the gap for NASA ASRS and UTM USS communities.  This design is a standard to ASTM F38, NASA UTM, and UAST Anonymous Accident Reporting Standards.  This open source project has the goal to make reporting easy to integrate, anonymous and secure, and combine to surface industry issues with a unified voice.  Together we are creating safe operations in the national air space a priority for all pilots in remote and general aviation communities.

## ASRS
>Anonymous Safety Reporting System (ASRS) is ideal for UAS providers of USS or UTM solutions wishing to implement a safety management program. UAST will offer a platform for no charge use to any valid system or drone operator to submit a detect and avoid occurrence, safety for pilot or drone issue, injury of any kind, common issue with commercial drone model creating risk, and a general public reporting tool with PII redaction.  We collect only the facts to monitor safety issues.  We do not advise on the rules and regulations in your area. Search quickly by any GPS coordinates to get a risk score and remote pilot reports. All data provided without warranty as is based on pilot reports (ASRS), website content, crowd source, social media, and federal databases permitted for this use.
 
##  USS, UTM, and Law Enforcement Application Developers Join In!
> Start to communicate directly with 40+ of the biggest companies and Federal agencies in one interface on safety reports and search your area for reports.  All information is redacted to only offer pilot and automated learning system a source for brokering and reporting as a third party observer of the industry.  
The UAST, UnmannedAircraftSafetyTeam.org, is a safety focused group interested in helping to make recommendations on how to safely integrate unmanned aircraft into society.
