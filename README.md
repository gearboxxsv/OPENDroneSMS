FAA Administrator Michael Huerta announced the formation of the team on August 2, 2016. Administrator Huerta committed that the FAA would work with stakeholders to charter a team to address safety issues related to the increasing number of UAS operations. Join the UAST membership and the FAAâ€™s UAS Integration Office to make drone flight safer by reporting incidents to the industry anonymously or participate on the team with the API toolset for long term integration into your product or service.

Unmanned Aircraft Safety Team (UAST) Public Reporting API is free to use.  There is a maximum query limit set per IP address of 100 queries per hour.

## ABOUT
>Anonymous Sighting Reporting System (ASRS) For UAS providers of USS or UTM solutions. We offer a platform for non charge use on any production system or drone to submit detect and avoid, safety for pilot or drone, and public reporting in a redacted and secure manner.  We collect only the facts to monitor safety issues, we provide valuable information to your platform for free to help make safety first place. We do not advise on the rules and regulations of UAS flight, we provide you information from other Remote Pilots and AI infused data streams to let you know the risk profile for any GPS coordinates. Its a safety belt for your application and the public not flying.
 
##  Reporting Tools For USS, UTM, and Law Enforcement Application Developers
> Start to communicate directly to 40+ of the biggest companies and Federal agencies in one interface on safety reports and search your area for reports.  All information is redacted to only offer pilot and automated data for your interpretation.  Report on incidents of unsafe UAS operation, uncontrolled flight, manufacturer issues that are causing risk to people and property, and poor judgement.  The UAST, UnmannedAircraftSafetyTeam.org, is a safety focused group interested in helping to make recommendations on how to safely integrate unmanned aircraft into society.  

We are teaming with OpenDroneID to enable it with OpenDroneSMS to power up any UAS business, smartphone application, or Law Enforcement Agency, or insurance platform with a simple reporting toolset.
