# OpenDroneSMS

Each flight operation will have issues, the public will have reports, and we all want to protect proprietary information and privacy, what to do? 

OpenDroneSMS is first a reporting tool, and can be a foundation to develop your own SMS program.  They key is to share your data, contribute code to the open source project, and integrate OpenDroneSMS anonymous and secure code.
